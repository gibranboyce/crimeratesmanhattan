        <h2> </b>Can the "Mayor Law and Order" Get Manhattan's Crime Rates Under Control?</b> </h2>

            with Midtown Manhattan showing the most significant jump.</h3>

<p> In 2022, Eric Adams was inaugurated to become the 110th Mayor of New York City, succeeding former Mayor Bill de Blasio. Earlier this fall, Mayor Adams – who had campaigned on being the “Mayor of Law and Order,” referencing his previous role as captain of the New York Police Department (NYPD) – was indicted on charges of alleged corruption and bribery from Turkey.</p>

<p> NYC is no stranger to high crime rates. However, over time, things seemed to be improving – particularly through the end of former Mayor De Blasio’s term in 2021. But with Adams’ hefty promises of restoring law and order to NYC, many New Yorkers feel discouraged – particularly as the mayor now faces criminal charges himself. </p>

<p> “We are definitely not at the numbers we want. We want to bring down crime,” Adams said in an April 2022 press conference – only three months into his term. </p>

<p> Midtown Manhattan has seen the highest crime rates. In 2021, under De Blasio, the crime rate was approximately 65 crimes per 1,000 people. As of 2022, under Adams, the crime rate was 97 crimes per 1,000 people. This means Midtown faced an increase in crime by nearly 33%. </p>

<p> Crime rates have gone down marginally since 2022. In 2023, Midtown had a crime rate of approximately 89 crimes per 1,000 people – still quite the jump from 2021. As the looming campaign season rapidly approaches, high crime rates alongside a very public federal indictment have left New Yorkers questioning if Adams is still the man for the job. </p>
