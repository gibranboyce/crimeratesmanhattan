        <h2> Mayor Adams is fighting to fix New York City's affordable housing crisis.
        But can he fix Brooklyn's gentrification problem?</h2>

    <p> On Thursday, City Council members in New York City pushed forward Mayor Eric Adams’ <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/11/21/adams-city-yes-housing-passes-zoning-committee/">"City of Yes"</a> plan, paving the way for his ambitious and controversial rezoning initiative, aimed at tackling the city’s affordable housing crisis. The plan seeks to add 80,000 housing units over the next 15 years. </p>

   <p> Nearly 500,000 residents spent at least half their income on rent and only 1.4% of apartments citywide were on the market in 2023, according to the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/about/2023-nychvs-selected-initial-findings.pdf">2023 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey</a> . With a lack of available and affordable housing, already marginalized communities tend to be the ones forced out first. </p>
    
    <p> According to the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, in 2005, the percentage of Black and white residents in Brooklyn were roughly the same at approximately 35%. However, rising housing costs and gentrification in Brooklyn has led to more than a 21% decrease in the neighborhood’s Black residential population, while its white population increased by more than 1% over time. Notably, this translates to roughly 100,000 Black residents moving out over the past twenty years and nearly 100,000 white residents moving in, according to census data from New York City Department of City Planning. </p>

    <p> “The African American and Afro Caribbean populations have been aging, with some retiring to places of origin, and their upwardly mobile children have been moving to the suburbs,” said John Mollenkopf, Director of the Center for Urban Research at CUNY. “Similar things have happened with the older white ethnic populations of Brooklyn, but that has been offset by the growth of young professional families attracted to the Brownstone neighborhoods with good access to Manhattan. Given the run up in housing prices in neighborhoods like Prospect Heights, Fort Greene, and Bed-Stuy, it has been harder for Black young people to move into them (given the income differentials between the racial groups).” </p>
